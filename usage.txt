Usage: szg [-bodxnsfp] [FILE] | [-h] | [-V]
       szg -[bodxnsfp]e EXPR
  -h --help    shows usage and exits
  -V --version shows version info and exits
  -b start in I/O mode binary
  -o start in I/O mode octal
  -d start in I/O mode decimal (default)
  -x start in I/O mode hexadecimal
  -n start in calculation mode unsigned (natural number)
  -s start in calculation mode signed   (default)
  -f start in calculation mode floating-point
  -p toggle prompt
  -e treat the rest of command line as expression

Command line calculator for 32-bit integers and floats.
Accepts the following constructs from stdin or input FILE if specified
or directly as command line arguments after as -e EXPR:
- math expressions built of .0-9a-f, g-z _ $x |&+-*/^ @x ~ (), eg. 2*(2-5)
  a-f are used for numbers in hexadecimal mode
  g-z are predefined variables
  _   is the result of the last operation
- $[a-z0-9_]+ are user-defined variables
- operator precedence: (), ~, ^, */%&, +-|
- math functions @s @c @a @l @e @r: sin cos atan log exp sqrt
- assignments to variables g-z or $x in form of x=expr or $foo=expr
- Commands
- Compounds of statements and leading or trailing commands
- whitespaces are ignored (not allowed within numbers)
- Comments between # and end-of-line

Incomplete expressions and assignments (desktop calculator workflow):
  Missing numbers are replaced by _ (last result), e.g x=*(+2) means x=_*(_+2)
  Unary minus is ~expr (tilde), -expr is interpreted as _-expr.

Floating point support:
  Floating-point numbers are accepted only in non-scientific form.
  szg stays in integer mode, until you explicitely switch to float mode
  with command F, or implicitly enter a float-format number (e.g. 2.3)
  as part of an expression. A division does NOT switch to float mode.
  Operator ^ (power) switches to float if the 2nd operand is negative.
  Swithing to float activates decimal I/O mode implicitly.

Commands:
  Single upper-case letters, same as the command line options, except h and V.
  Alternative form: backslash plus lowercase letter.
  Use command Q or ^D (EOF on Unix) or ^C (interrupt) to exit.
