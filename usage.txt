Usage: szg [-bodxnsfp] [FILE] | [-h] | [-V]
       szg -[bodxnsfp]e EXPR
  -h --help    shows usage and exits
  -V --version shows version info and exits
  -b start in I/O mode binary
  -o start in I/O mode octal
  -d start in I/O mode decimal (default)
  -x start in I/O mode hexadecimal
  -n start in calculation mode unsigned (natural number)
  -s start in calculation mode signed   (default)
  -f start in calculation mode floating-point
  -p toggle prompt
  -e treat the rest of command line as expression

Command line calculator for 32-bit integers and floats.
Accepts the following constructs from stdin or input FILE if specified
or directly as command line arguments after as -e EXPR:
- math expressions built of .0-9A-F G-Z _ |&+-*/ @x ~ (), eg. 2*(2-5)
  A-F are used for numbers in hexadecimal mode
  G-Z are predefined variables
  _   is the result of the last operation
- operator precedence: (), ~, */%&, +-|
- math functions @s @c @a @l @e @r: sin cos atan log exp sqrt
- assignments to variables G-Z in form of X=expression
- Commands
- Compounds of statements and leading or trailing commands
- whitespaces are ignored (not allowed within numbers)
- Comments between # and end-of-line

Incomplete expressions and assignments (desktop calculator workflow):
  Missing numbers are replaced by _ (last result), e.g X=*(+2) means X=_*(_+2)
  Unary minus is ~expr (tilde), -expr is interpreted as _-expr.

Floating point support:
  Floating-point numbers are accepted only in non-scientific form.
  szg stays in integer mode, until you explicitely switch to float mode
  with command f, or implicitly enter a float-format number (e.g. 2.3)
  as part of an expression. A division does NOT switch to float mode.
  Swithing to float activates decimal I/O mode implicitly.

Commands:
  Single lower-case letters, same as the command line options, except h and V.
  Command p toggles the prompt.
  Use command q or ^D (EOF on Unix) or ^C (interrupt) to exit.

See man szg for more details.
