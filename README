szg is a command line calculator with an extremely fast and intuitive workflow.

Features
--------
32-bit integer or floating-point arithmetic
Decimal, binary, octal or hexadecimal format (commands D, B, O, X)
Input:
  szg           - expressions, variable assignments and commands on stdin
  szg <FILE>    - from file specified on command line
  szg -e <expr> - expression directly from the command line
Output of calculations on stdout
Prompt indicating integer/float and bin/oct/dec/hex mode
Error messages (syntax error, division by zero) or stderr
Unlimited undo
User defined variables like $foo
Operators ()~ ^ */% +- &| =   ATTENTION: unary minus is ~ (tilde)
Symbol _ means last result, like Perl/Python
Missing identifier means _ (+5 means last result + 5) like Perl
Math functions @s @c @a @l @e @r = sin cos atan log exp sqrt
Optional unsigned arithmetic (commands N, S)
Floating-point mode never upon division, only upon user request, like Python
Combination of expressions/commands on same line

Examples
--------
d XffffD  # Convert hexadecimal to decimal
65535
d 4+3     # Addition
7
d *       # Both operands missing, means 7*7
49
d /2      # integer division, result remains integer
24
d /5.0    # floating point division upon request
4.8
f @r      # square root, missing operand, means @r(4.8)
2.19089
f B       # prompt shows float mode, look how bits are stored in memory
01000000,00001100,00110111,10001100
f $foo=   # store in variable $foo

Compilation Instructions
------------------------
Source tarball at http://linux.subogero.com/deb/
It can be compiled and installed on Linux or Windows/Cygwin.
Packages needed: gcc, make, flex, bison, mingw32 (for native Win binaries only)
On Windows, it runs both in Cygwin and Windows command line windows.
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install # installs to /usr/bin (and C:\WINDOWS on Cygwin)

Installation of Windows Binaries
--------------------------------
Zip files at http://linux.subogero.com/deb/ contain compiled Windows binaries.
Download and extract in a new directory.
Open a Cygwin-terminal window there and type “make install”.
Or simply copy .win/szg.exe (Win32) or .w64/szg.exe (Win x64) to C:\WINDOWS
if you don't have Cygwin.

Debian packages
---------------
Add the lines below to /etc/apt/sources.list to install szg via apt-get:
deb http://linux.subogero.com/deb/ /
deb-src http://linux.subogero.com/deb/ /

Add my PGP public-key to verify package authenticity:
# curl linux.subogero.com/deb/subogero.asc | apt-key add -

Finally, install szg:
# apt-get update
# apt-get install szg

Note: rpm packages are available at the same locations too.
