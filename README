szg is a command line calculator with an extremely fast and intuitive workflow.

Features
--------
32-bit integer or floating-point arithmetic
Missing operands or _ anywhere are replaced with the last result:
Input:
  szg           - expressions, variable assignments and commands on stdin
  szg <FILE>    - from file specified on command line
  szg -e <expr> - expression directly from the command line
Comma-grouping of input allowed
Unlimited undo
Operators ()~ ^ */% +- &| =   ATTENTION: unary minus is ~ (tilde)
Math functions @s @c @a @l @e @r = sin cos atan log exp sqrt
User defined variables like $foo
Decimal, binary, octal or hexadecimal format (commands D, B, O, X)
Unsigned integer, signed integer and float modes (commands N, S, F)
Prompt shows unsigned/integer/float mode and bin/oct/dec/hex format (DdBbOoXxf)
Floating-point mode never upon division, only upon F or float literal
Combination of expressions/commands on same line
Comments starting with #

Examples
--------
d XffffD  # Prompt d: signed int mode, decimal format. Convert hex to decimal
65535
d 4+3     # Addition
7
d *       # Both operands missing, means 7*7
49
d /2      # integer division, result remains integer
24
d /5.0    # floating point division upon request, shown by prompt f
4.8
f @r      # square root, missing operand, means @r(4.8)
2.19089
f B       # look at the bitwise storage of the float number in memory
