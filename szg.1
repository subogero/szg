Any combination of commands is allowed, last command wins in case of conflict.
E.g. szg -xnods starts in signed decimal mode.

Unknown options and commands are ignored without a warning.
.SH BACKGROUND
.B szg
is a command line calculator, originally for integer arithmetics, inspired by
.BR bc (1),
desktop calculators and microcontroller programming. Micros often lack
floating-point support, so all calculations are integer-based. During
debugging, one often wishes to simulate calculations with a desktop/GUI
calculator, only to find everything going floating-point after the first
division. That's where
.BR bc (1)
comes into the picture. But it has no hexadecimal support and its workflow
is rather cumbersome. Adding 2 to a previous result cannot be done with
simply typing
.BR "+ 2 Enter" .
And how many times have you mistyped something on a desktop calculator
wishing to undo the last operation? Or wished to have more than one memory?
.PP
Floating point support is available as well.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The main requirements for
.BR szg (1)
are:
.br
\- command line interface with previous results visible on the screen
.br
\- unlimited undo
.br
\- decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal I/O modes
.br
\- signed and unsigned integer calculation modes
.br
\- floating point mode only upon user request, never upon division
.br
\- ability to go on from previous result with incomplete expression
.br
\- a fair amount of memory registers with intuitive use
.PP
.BR szg (1)
takes expressions, assignments and commands on stdin and writes the results
to stdout or the specified output FILE upon pressing
.BR Enter .
.SS EXPRESSIONS
.BR szg (1)
expressions are built of numbers
.B [0-9A-F.]+
variables
.B [G-Z]
last result
.B _
and operators listed below in descending precedence:
.br
.B ()
\   brackets to override operator precedence
.br
.B ~ @x
\ prefix operators        : unary minus, math functions
.br
.B */%&
\ multiplicative operators: multiply, divide, modulo, bitwise AND
.br
.B +-|
\  additive operators      : add, substract, bitwise OR
.PP
Math functions:
.B @s @c @a @l @e @r
= sin cos atan log exp sqrt
.PP
Incomplete expressions are where a number is missing from
between operators. The last result
.B _
is used automatically instead.
.br
The ultimate incomplete expression is the empty string, meaning the last result.
.PP
Attention with unary minus:
.br
.B \-expr
means substracting expr from the last result
.B _-expr
, not the negation of expr.
For unary minus use the
.B ~
(tilde) operator.
.SS Floating point support
Floating point numbers can be entered in non-scientific form only.
Examples:
.B 2.3  .0456
.PP
Floting point mode is activated according to the following rules:
.br
\- never upon division
.br
\- implicitly, if an entered expression contains a float-format number
.br
\- explicitly, with command f
.PP
Floating point numbers are displayed in scientific format only if necessary.
Switching to floating-point implies switching to decimal I/O mode.
Once in float mode, the commands
.B b o x
(binary, octal, hexadecimal) set binary output-mode only, input mode remains decimal.
.PP
Switching back from floating-point mode to either signed or unsigned integer mode
works with the commands
.B s
and
.B n
, respectively.
.SS ASSIGNMENTS
.BR szg (1)
assignments are in the form of
.BR [G-Z]=expr .
The expr may be incomplete, including the ulimate incomplete expression, the
empty string, thus
.B X=
assigns the last result to X.
.SS COMMANDS
Commands are single lowercase letters.
.PP
b binary I/O mode
.br
o octal I/O mode
.br
d decimal I/O mode
.br
x hexadecimal I/O mode
.PP
n unsigned (natural number) calculation mode
.br
s signed calculation mode
.br
f floating-point calculation mode
.PP
p toggle prompt
.br
u undo, unlimited depth, no redo
.br
q or ^D (EOF Unix) or ^C (interrupt) to quit
.PP
Signed / unsigned calculation modes affect only */% operations and decimal
IO, nothing else.
.PP
By default, a prompt is indicating IO and calculation mode,
if input is coming from a terminal (no pipe, no input file).
.PP
Undo does remember changes in calculation or I/O mode.
.SS COMPOUNDS
.BR szg (1)
accepts combinations of expressions or statements with a leading or trailing command or both.
For example
.B x FFFE+1 d
switches to hex mode temporarily to evaluate  FFFE+1 then displays the result 65535 in decimal.
.SS COMMENTS
Comments between
.B #
and end-of-line.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.BR szg (1)
prints diagnostic messages to stderr, thus they appear on the terminal by
default. After the error
.BR szg (1)
may ignore the entire input line, or just the wrong part of it, or even
replace the wrong part with the last result.
Don't forget to undo in suspicious cases. Worse is better.
.SS syntax error
The entered expression cannot be parsed
.SS unknown command
Entered lowercase letter does not correspond to a known command
.SS unknown function
Unimplemented @x sequence (function)
.SS division by zero
Attempt at division by zero
.SS float modulo
Attempt at modulo
.B %
operation on a floating-point number
.SS n.a. for negative
Attempt at math functions @l @r (log sqrt) for a negative number
.SS n.a. for zero
Attempt at math function @l (log) for zero
.SS unable to parse number
When entering 1.2.3 or 12 in binary mode or 12.34FF in float mode
